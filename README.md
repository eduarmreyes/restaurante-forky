## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Run `cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env`.
1. You can update the `./back-end/.env` file with the connection URL's to your ElephantSQL database instance.
1. You should not need to make changes to the `./front-end/.env` file unless you want to connect to a backend at a location other than `http://localhost:5001`.
1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start your server in development mode.

## Important Note: 
If you are having `error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported` when running the start or test script, please add `--openssl-legacy-provider` to the 'start' and 'test:start:frontend' script and try again.
Example:
```
"start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start"
```

## Running tests

This project has unit, integration, and end-to-end (e2e) tests. You can run the tests with the command:

> **Note** When running `npm run test:X` If the frontend tests fail, the tests will stop before running the backend tests. Remember, you can always run `npm run test:X:backend` or `npm run test:X:frontend` to target a specific part of the application.

- `npm test` runs _all_ tests.
- `npm run test:backend` runs _all_ backend tests.
- `npm run test:frontend` runs _all_ frontend tests.
- `npm run test:e2e` runs only the end-to-end tests.

If you would like a reminder of which npm scripts are available, run `npm run` to see a list of available commands.

Note that the logging level for the backend is set to `warn` when running tests and `info` otherwise.

> **Note**: After running `npm test`, `npm run test:X`, or `npm run test:e2e` you might see something like the following in the output: `[start:frontend] Assertion failed:`. This is not a failure, it is just the frontend project getting shutdown automatically.

> **Note**: If you are getting a `unable to resolve dependency tree` error when running the frontend tests, run the following command: `npm install --force --prefix front-end`. This will allow you to run the frontend tests.

> **Hint**: If you stop the tests before they finish, it can leave the test database in an unusual state causing the tests to fail unexpectedly the next time you run them. If this happens, delete all tables in the test database, including the `knex_*` tables, and try the tests again.

### Frontend test timeout failure

Running the frontend tests on a resource constrained computer may result in timeout failures.

If you believe your implementation is correct, but needs a bit more time to finish, you can update the `testTimeout` value in `front-end/e2e/jest.config.js`. A value of 10000 or even 12000 will give each test a few more seconds to complete.

#### Screenshots

To help you better understand what might be happening during the end-to-end tests, screenshots are taken at various points in the test.

The screenshots are saved in `front-end/.screenshots` and you can review them after running the end-to-end tests.

You can use the screenshots to debug your code by rendering additional information on the screen.
